# Next-Level-Experience

A small repo to contain links and routes to various npm packages I find useful, cool, or just want to track for future use cases.

## Nice ORMs

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) – This is the main one I use and I really like it. It's robust, quick to set up, and pairs very nicely with JS.
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) – This is another good one; I’ve only used it once.

## Data Stuff

- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) – God-sent. I don't know where I'd be without it. It simplifies making calls to your backend with a strongly typed API.
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) – Goes hand-in-hand with tRPC. Goated for strongly typing forms and user input.

## UI

Probably my favorite thing ever is finding new component libraries I like.

But first, a shoutout to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). If this isn't being used, I am so sorry for your loss of time making huge lists of CSS classes. It makes styling simple and predefines well over 100 quick utility classes for your components.

- [Tailwind Animator](https://www.tailwindcss-animated.com/configurator.html)
- [Gradient Maker](https://www.creative-tim.com/twcomponents/gradient-generator)

### Component Libraries

- [Tailwind UI Blocks](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks?ref=sidebar)
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/input) – Probably the best on this list. I wish they had more, but I digress.
- [Particles.js](https://particles.js.org/) – Not super practical, but lightweight and fun for effects.
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) – Has some cool components; not much else to say.
- [FlyonUI](https://flyonui.com/docs/component/?theme=light) – Mimics iOS design; interesting find.
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) – Modern UI components, many strongly typed. Great for rapid development.
- [ReactBits](https://www.reactbits.dev/text-animations/split-text) – Cool advanced animations. Not practical, but fun.

### Icons

- [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) – Good for generic icons. Sometimes missing niche ones.
- [HugeIcons](https://hugeicons.com/) – Large collection. Most require a membership for SVG/large sizes.
- [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/) – All free, just requires attribution.

## Cool Tech

- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/ui) – Insanely cool library. Build native apps for all platforms using web tech. Also supports direct native SDK implementations.
